GREETINGS. I'M SKAROT.
DO'ER OF TOO MUCH, SELLER OF TOO LITTLE.

CURRENTLY LEARNING CODE AND SUCH, SO DO BE PATIENT WITH MY PROGRESS.

I WRITE IN CAPS FOR NOTES, SINCE IT HELPS ME REMEMBER BETTER.

About Me:
- When I use "[ ]" in speech and writing, it is to notate an explanation or action.
- I _really_ love dogs and cats.
- Rootbeer is my favorite soda
- People take me for one of two things at first glance:
  
  [1]: An eldritch being that embodies the "Chaotic Good" alignment to a "t".
  
  [2]: Hyper professional with an imposing presense.
  
  I am both of these things to a small extent, but mostly I'm just a dude who loves bara tiddy and conversation

So why am I here?

  Well, I wish to learn. Everything at some point, perhaps. 
  Most importantly, I want to be useful and fill that massive void in my chest that screams: "You'll never be good enough!"
  
  Fuck you, I'm fantastically average and I'm living for it.

You can contact me on Discord [Skarot#0001] if you want a timely response.
otherwise, you can shove off and email me at skarotofficial@gmail.com.
I _might_ get to you in a matter of business weeks if you do.

My current projects are as follows:

1. "Cloudy" - a story about two superhero boys falling for eachother that breaks every rule of writing in the attempt at transcribing a dysfunctional mind.

2. "Nova Mechanica" - a synthwave, techno, and chiptune album

3. "The Tomes of Night" - a tabletop rpg system, as well as a VTT custom creation kit aiming to improve Homebrew, the simplicity/complexity tradeoff problem, and allow for the development of more advanced custom TTRPG systems

4. [unnamed MMORPG]

5. [unnamed OWRPG]

6. "Pokemon XI" - A fangame to end all fangames, looking to be created in Unity 4/5 to show nintendo how to make a goddamn game.

I am Looking for people to assemble into teams to tackle some of these [mainly 4, 5, and 6.], so if any of these things interest you, please feel free to contact me with the info that was given above.

Thank you for looking at this, and I hope you have the day you deserve.
